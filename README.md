##AIMAS group fortytwo project

###1. Group members

- Maciej Jan Korzepa
- Nicklas Arenth Pingel
- Павел Папсуевич
- Sindri Jóhannes Westlund

###2. Ideas

The library contains:
  * PDDL implementations of the problem. (Library implementation)
  * QLearning algorithm (Nicklas)
  * Base project (Handin 1)
  * Algorithms for solving the problem including (BFS, DFS, A*, WA* and the Greedy approach).

###3. What to do now?

Work in progress:
  * Heuristic thoughts and experiments
  * QLearning for guiding the AI to find the correct solution by reinforcement learning.
  * Partial Order Planning
  * Other
